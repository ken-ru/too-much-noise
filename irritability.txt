I.. I still feel irritability.

It just happens out-of-the-blue. You know, I wish I could just snap it out. but it's unavoidable and sometimes frequent. 

It's frustrating because not only that I happen to feel frustrations, but very intrusive thoughts also. 

I can't be vulnerable about it, I feel embarassed about it. 

I know, venting can be helpful to establish clarity, reassurement and remove doubts, 
but in the end, I feel this enormous insecurity in being too-open/much openness.

I admit. I still won't budge from the societal standards. 

I still feel being vulnerable is a show of weakness. I know myself that all feelings are valid regardless of genders, but I can't help it.

I think this is one of the societal norms I am afraid of. 

Not only the problems in societal norms I am afraid about, but also to my intrusive thoughts. 

It's very frequent and I think it almost governs me every single day. I can't have a normal day without having an intrusive thought. 

It's troubling because it dictates my mood.

I can't be calm in the inside, sometimes I do, but not long I can maintain stability in my racing emotions.

days in my immersion work, I'm supposed to entertain clients in a casual manner, but I still stutter and flustered in what I deliver in conversations.
man, I will never be confident again.

 I can never feel fully feel that shit. imagine talking to someone and all you ever think is your plot to escape. it's too sad. 
I'm not normal anymore. 

I believe and I can differ myself in a spectrum where,
normal       -         insane (i.e splitting, sudden mood-shifts, others)

I can be both, I fluctuate time-to-time between feeling normal and feeling insane. 
but now, I feel like insanity is being too frequent now. this has been going on for a long time now.
