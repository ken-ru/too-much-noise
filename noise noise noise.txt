I can't seem to vibe well to my friends and I always feel so out-of-place when I am with them. 
I always think of staying away from them and plot my escape.

I'm that worthless person around them, I feel so out-of-place. 
I feel like I'm casually ignored for a reason. I think it's my poor character on display. I'm not someone worthwhile talking to. 
I sometimes think am I their friend? or just someone to put on display just because I was told to.

I think they're somehow changing. Something that's out my reach. Something that I can never force myself to be.

Not eager to take a seat and talk to them anymore. I choose to keep things I don't talk about to myself. 
I think venting my suppressed thoughts are senseless to a group who are living their lives better.

It's best to leave them alone. 
I'll just leave them be. I think it's time to stop.

Oh, why do you cling on both sides, Kenjie. What do you really want? What path do you like to take?
Why do you choose on being with friends but end up plotting your escape? Is it that everything doesn't
go as you think it would be? WHAT IS IT!? PICK A SIDE GODDAMIT!

YOU WANT TO FEEL HAPPY BUT YOU CAN'T 

YOU WANT TO FEEL WHOLE BUT WHEN YOU DO THINGS TO FEEL WHOLE YOU FEEL EMPTY

WHAT THE FUCK
WHAT THE FUCK

I can't fix myself. I want to end myself.

I'm a worthless piece of shit. That's it go fuck youself. PLEASE.
