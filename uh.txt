I'm sad

I can't seem to cope my emotional disturbance all alone. 

I figured out that I really need someone to talk to constantly (in person) to lessen my intrusive
thoughts I deal daily and emotional instability. 

Talking makes me feel good. I think talking makes me feel motivated and see myself developing than staying
in my room - active in cyberspace. 

There are also times where I want myself to be alone. It's not the idea of generalizing the thought that "I must be away
from people" but I think I only consider talking to ones I like to be occupied with - and sometimes, it depends on the mood. 

I just want to have some time casually talking to someone I feel comfortable with. 

It eases my mind well. I do have certain occassions where I have my social anxieties pent up (accumu-
lated from staying at home), 
but I can manage it just fine nowadays (since I already dealt the recent problems I had couple of months ago). I think I'm just
awfully lonely. I can never do anything about this either. I'm not feeling going anywhere at the moment.

I feel so sad

I don't know what my purpose in life is, I can't do my homeworks done, I keep on making my anxiety go worse. I don't have the energy to get it done. I get
irritable, sad, somewhat happy over the course of several hours in my room. I don't get things done.

There's this thought where I come to hate everything I write, I despise everything I am, I get relapses of cringe moments I had in the past - I just don't
know whether I can love myself - if there's a chance.

I feel so unhappy

I used to be happy by myself and not go to the extent of sadness in what I feel now. I always keep on assuming my friends don't care about me anymore.

A small hint of no reply from them makes me think they don't care about me anymore. I feel abandoned. I know this is just a thought but subconsciously, I am
buying it.
