It was my first time traveling on my own. 
I was stressed out at home, I thought I could take a breather by having some time with myself alone in the city.

I took a bus. I reached my destination about an hour. I went to a mall, I bought earbuds, had lunch at fast food, bought sticky notes, and snacks.

I had a little bit of fun. Not that happy-dappy, but just normal (kinda, I guess).

I was in a good mood at fast food, I was filled up. Later then, I started acting strange along the way. 

I didn't know what to do, I was walking in circles. 

I felt like going through that feeling once again about being empty and not being whole inside.
 
I happen to be in a flat mood. I was not happy nor sad. I just felt so lame. 

There, I thought I wouldn't be placed in a position again like that in a certain place, but I was wrong.
It's just there and it occurs out-of-nowhere.

I beg myself a serotonin a day wouldn't be too much to ask for. I'm fed up in myself. I don't like myself.

I'm sick living in state of (i.e) instability, splitting, irritability, rapid mood-swings. 

I don't enjoy myself that well anymore. I'm incapable finding happiness. I don't enjoy playing games anymore either.

I lack passion and motivation to get through the day. I wake up bombarded with thoughts. I just feel empty all the time.

I do like talking to my friends, but I can't stay-connected to them all the time. I stopped leaning or constant venting to them. 

I'm just an inconvenience if I do so.

I'm sick and tired bearing countless sleepless nights dealing with myself. 

It's emotionally draining. I can't concentrate anymore. I feel like I'm out of my mind. I think I'm going insane day by day.
